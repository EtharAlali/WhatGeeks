#### Licensing
It's not as simple as you might think. We do not support the use or distribution of the code, or derivatives of the code in this repository under a Free Cultural license!

Shock Horror! Why? 

Because not every organisation is ethical. Here are some exemptions which take us away from the Free Cultural license.

* Defence or military organisations and their suppliers
* Organisations which promote or in any way fund violence, torture, rape, genocide, racism, xenophobia, ethnic cleansing, or any purposely negative destructive human endeavour. 
* Political organisations or politicians in the course of their remit in that role
* Donald Trump
* Organisations, their staff, directors, board and agents who carry on unethical business practises, are late/non-payers and/or have been subject to legal proceedings for non-payment of invoices, whether or not those proceedings were concluded. This is indefinite. If you've not dealt with us, then you're fine. We do this because we support ethical business practices. If you're not sure, get in touch. 
* Commercial purposes - This is not the same as the previous point, which excludes the aforementioned agents in the event they use it for non-commercial purposes. 

Restrictive? Yes, but so is Donald Trump.
